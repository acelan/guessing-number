Guessing Numbers
================
Guessing numbers is a game to guess the number in participant's mind.
In the game, you should set up a 4 digital number in your mind, and trying to guessing the number computer created.
When guessing, computer will respond you how many 'A' and 'B' you got from the number you guessed. 'A' means you guess the right number in the right position, and 'B' means the number you guessed is right, but in the wrong position. And then plays in turn until one player got 4 'A'.

This is the first application I wrote for iOS just for practicing.
